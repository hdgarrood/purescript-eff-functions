# DEPRECATED

This code has been moved into `Control.Monad.Eff.Uncurried` in [`purescript-eff`](https://github.com/purescript/purescript-eff).

## purescript-eff-functions

Types for effectful uncurried functions, as well as functions for converting
back and forth between them. Useful for FFI bindings.

Inspired by [joneshf's comment](https://github.com/purescript/purescript/issues/616#issuecomment-57800502)
on a random old github issue.
